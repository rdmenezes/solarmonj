This project was started to address the lack of Linux software available for monitoring JFY solar inverters ( http://www.jfy-tech.com/ ).

Rather than recreating the full featured Windows software in Linux, we decided to develop a small app which can be run using cron to poll the inverter.
From here the data can easily be parsed by other software keeping the actual monitoring code small and simple.

This software has been developed specifically for the Raspberry Pi ( raspberrypi.org ) but it should work in all Linux environments.
